Jupyter Notebook examples for querying the NBA Stats API with Python
#
This project uses Python in a Jupyter Notebook to interact with the NBA Stats API. 
Game and team data are fetched via the nba_api package, then organised into Pandas DataFrames for easy querying and analysis. 
I leverage pandasâ€™ powerful data manipulation methods to extract insights and employ matplotlib to generate clear, illustrative charts that visualise key trends and statistics.
